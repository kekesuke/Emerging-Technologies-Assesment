# Emerging-Technologies-Assesment
## What is this repository for ?
### (Machine learning algorithms & Quantum computing using Scikit Python Libraries)

###### This repository contains an overview of what I have done for the module that I am currently studying. The module is called Emerging-Technologies. The repository provides some insights of my work on [`Scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/) and `Quantum computing` (Machine learning algorithms & Quantum computing). There is a  concise overview of the scikit-learn Python Libraries. Inside this repository you are going to find a few `Jupyter notebooks`, the main ones being: scikit-learn and quantum-deutsch which I created and worked on.
- Few of the tools I used for the scikit-learn jupyter notebook are : [`Pandas`](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas) and [`Numpy`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html). They are the required Libraries for Python data analysis and manipulation in order to show the examples of the algorithms I picked from `Scikit-Learn`.
- The second notebook `quantum-deutsch` contains an overview of what Quantum computing is how it it is different from a classical computer, and how to simulate it using `Qiskit`.

### This project has two [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/):
1. [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
2. [Quantum-deutsch](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/deutsch-jozsa.html)

## The few methods to run those notebooks are:

#### Using Jupyter lab
1. Copy git repository URL.
2. Create blank folder.
3. Open cmder pointing to that blank folder URL.
4. Type "git clone (URL here)".
5. Type cd 'Emerging-Technologies-Assesment' into cmder
6. Type "jupyter lab" into cmder.
Click into scikit-learn.ipynb or quantum-deutsch.ipynb and click on the two arrows "Restart the kernel, then re-run the whole notebook" - model should run all cells after a few minutes.

#### Using Docker
1. Copy git repository URL.
2. Create blank folder.
3. Open cmder pointing to that blank folder URL.
4. Type "git clone (URL here)".
5. Type cd 'Emerging-Technologies-Assesment' into cmder
5. Type "docker-compose up" into cmder.
6. Wait till image is build.
6. Copy the url from cmder that docker has created into your browser.
Click into scikit-learn.ipynb or quantum-deutsch.ipynb and click on the two arrows "Restart the kernel, then re-run the whole notebook" - model should run all cells after a few minutes.

#### Using nbviewer
By Clicking on one of the images nbviewer
