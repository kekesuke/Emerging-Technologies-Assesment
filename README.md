# Emerging-Technologies-Assesment
# What is this repository for ?
### (Machine learning algorithms & Quantum computing using Scikit Python Libraries)

## This repository contain an overview of what I have done for module that I am currently studying. The module is called Emerging-Technologies. The repository provides some insight of my work on [`Scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/) and `Quantum computing` (Machine learning algorithms & Quantum computing). Inside this repository you going to find few `Jupyter notebooks` which I created and worked upon. Few of tools I have used are: [`Pandas`](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas) and [`Numpy`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html) they are required Libraries for Python visualization in order to show the examples of the algorithms I picked from `Scikit-Learn`.

### This project has two [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/):
1. [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
2. [Quantum-deutsch](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/deutsch-jozsa.html)

# How to run the those notebooks?
